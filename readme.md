### About this project
 
- This project is inspired from jail broken spotify car thing, esp32 spotify controls and Deej.
- This is a project to get the media controls from a windows machine to an esp32 with a touch display.
- media controls in the session, the current media playing in your system, may it be playing on browser or spotify or anything. the controls would be play, pause, skip next, skip previous, volume controls.
- with the fourth upload I have made a potentiometer to control the master volume using PyCaw. manually got all the decibel values to set a specific volume level on windows
- with the future uploads, I will be creating branches with versions of this software, making it better and more robust.
- check out the branches for any feature updates, a new feature will have its own new branch, and the main branch will contain the latest feature, or code that I created.
