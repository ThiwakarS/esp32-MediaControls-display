### About this project
 
- This project is inspired from jail broken spotify car thing and esp32 spotify controls
- This is a project to get the media controls from a windows machine to an esp32 with a touch display.
- media controls in the session, the current media playing in your system, may it be playing on browser or spotify or anything. the controls would be play, pause, skip next, skip previous, colume controls.
- with the second upload I have created a python file to get the currently playing session info, thumbnails of the media and with error handling.
- with the future uploads, I will be creating branches with versions of this software, making it better and more robust.
- check out the branches for any feature updates, a new feature will have its own new branch, and the main branch will contain the latest feature, or code that I created.
