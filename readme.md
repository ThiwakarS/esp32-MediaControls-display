### About this project
 
- This project is inspired from jail broken spotify car thing, esp32 spotify controls and Deej.
- This is a project to get the media controls from a windows machine to an esp32 with a display.
- Media controls in the session, the current media playing in your system, may it be playing on browser or spotify or anything. the controls would be play, pause, skip next, skip previous, volume controls.
- With the fifth upload i have successfully made multiple potentiometers work together, controlling master volume and individual app volumes.
- Added 7 buttons and 4 potentiometers, which can be fully customisable.
- The no of buttons, no of sliders and the functions can be easily configured from the config.yaml file.
- Added a main file to take charge of everything.
- For the next step, I will add a 128*64 oled display for displaying title of media playing and much more.
- with the future uploads, I will be creating branches with versions of this software, making it better and more robust.
- check out the branches for any feature updates, a new feature will have its own new branch, and the main branch will contain the latest feature, or code that I created.
